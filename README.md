# Canon-Backup
A shell script to backup my Canon EOS 30D raw photos and convert them to open in GIMP. Depends on gphoto2 and rawtherapee.

Please note that this is a very rudimentary script. As far as I know, as of version 0.1.3, it works completely IF
  the following conditions are met:
  
    - You have a Canon EOS 30D camera plugged into a linux system WITH AT LEAST ONE picture on a compact flash card.
    - You have gphoto2 installed
    - You have rawtherapee installed
    - You have sudo access
    - You don't mind that the pictures are organized in ~/Pictures/Canon-Backup-[current date]
    
  And even then I only know for absolute sure that it works on my system, so use at your own risk.
  
In the next few weeks I'm gonna add some error checking and stuff so it's not so risky. That's in v0.2 I believe.

Not that anyone gives a shit, but just in case some newb comes along and says "hey I'm gonna run this random
  script off of github", well, this is a total hack, just a quick automation of commands I run every day anyway.
  
  I just wanted to be clear about that.
  Just in case.
